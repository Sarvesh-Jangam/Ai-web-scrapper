The provided text does not contain descriptions of specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities and their solutions.  It describes a "Page Not Found" error on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) website and mentions general security best practices (like using HTTPS).  Therefore, no vulnerabilities and solutions can be extracted.

Here's a structured breakdown of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and their solutions mentioned in the provided text:

**1. Exploited Git Vulnerability**

* **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary file write vulnerability in Git (CVE not specified)
* **Description:**  An exploited vulnerability in Git allows for remote code execution by writing arbitrary files.
* **Solution:** Immediately patch the Git vulnerability.  CISA urges federal agencies to do so.


**2. OneFlip Attack**

* **Vulnerability:** OneFlip, a Rowhammer-based attack.
* **Description:** This attack flips a single bit in neural network weights to stealthily backdoor AI systems without impacting performance.  It could affect AI in vehicles and facial recognition systems.
* **Solution:** The text doesn't offer a specific solution, but implies research into mitigating Rowhammer attacks and securing AI systems against bit-flipping vulnerabilities is necessary.


**3. Zero-Day Vulnerability in Apple Products**

* **Vulnerability:**  Zero-day vulnerability in iOS and macOS (CVE not specified)
* **Description:** A zero-day vulnerability was exploited in highly targeted attacks.
* **Solution:** Apple has released iOS and macOS updates to resolve the vulnerability.


**4. Clickjacking Vulnerability in Password Managers**

* **Vulnerability:** Clickjacking vulnerability in multiple password managers.
* **Description:**  Nearly a dozen password managers were found vulnerable to clickjacking attacks, potentially leading to data theft.
* **Solution:** The text doesn't specify solutions for each password manager, but implies that developers of these applications need to implement clickjacking protections.


**5.  n-day and Zero-day Vulnerabilities exploited by Silk Typhoon**

* **Vulnerability:**  Multiple n-day and zero-day vulnerabilities.
* **Description:** The Chinese hacking group Silk Typhoon exploited these vulnerabilities for initial access to victim systems.
* **Solution:** The text does not provide specific solutions, but it implies patching systems against known vulnerabilities (n-day) and implementing robust security practices to prevent exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities is crucial.


**6.  Critical Flaws in Rockwell FactoryTalk, Micro800, and ControlLogix Products**

* **Vulnerability:** Critical flaws in Rockwell Automation products (CVE not specified)
* **Description:**  Critical vulnerabilities were present in Rockwell's FactoryTalk, Micro800, and ControlLogix products.
* **Solution:**  The flaws have been patched.  Users should update their products.


**7.  Vulnerabilities in various password managers (general)**

* **Vulnerability:**  Unspecified vulnerabilities in password managers.
* **Description:** The text mentions that password managers are vulnerable to data theft, although the specific vulnerabilities are not detailed.
* **Solution:**  No specific solutions are provided.  Implies the need for improved security practices and updates by password manager developers.


The text mentions various other security incidents (data breaches, ransomware attacks, DDoS attacks), but these are not vulnerabilities in specific software or systems, but rather consequences of existing vulnerabilities or inadequate security practices.  Therefore, they are not included in the above list.
