### **General Vulnerabilities**

*   **Unauthorized Frame Window (Framing/Clickjacking)**
    *   **Description:** A web page is displayed within an unauthorized frame, posing a risk for clickjacking attacks or user deception.
    *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement security headers like `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'` on the web server to prevent unauthorized framing. Ensure redirects to official, secure URLs (e.g., `https://nvd.nist.gov`) are properly enforced.

*   **Insecure Website Connection / Phishing Risk**
    *   **Description:** Users may share sensitive information on websites that are not official government sites (.gov) or lack secure HTTPS connections, increasing the risk of data exposure or phishing attacks.
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation:** Users should be educated to verify website authenticity (e.g., `.gov` domain) and security (HTTPS, indicated by a lock icon). Website administrators must ensure all sensitive interactions occur over HTTPS connections and that official domains are clearly communicated.
